I bring a people-first approach to analytics, rooted in a deep understanding of how operational systems work and how data can be used to make them better. I thrive at the intersection of people, process, and performance--translating complex data into strategic insights that drive decision-making and long-term value. My analytical style is built around clarity, curiosity, and communication: I don’t just surface the numbers, I tell the story behind them. Whether I’m building dashboards, identifying trends, or collaborating across teams, I’m focused on outcomes that are not only measurable, but meaningful. I’m especially energized by projects that serve mission-driven goals and improve user experiences--from internal workflows to customer-facing solutions. Outside of work, you’ll likely find me exploring the outdoors--backpacking, climbing, or traveling to new places. I bring that same spirit of exploration and adaptability into every project I take on. 📩 Open to full-time roles in data analytics or operations, especially with organizations driving purposeful, impactful change. Let’s connect.

I have thrived in the remote work environment for the past 6 years. Merging my desire to add value to mission driven companies, while exploring all over the western US. If I'm not working, I am always in the mountains. Whether I'm backpacking, rock climbing, or enjoying a hike to an alpine lake, I love connecting with nature while challenging myself physically. I'm currently training for a 44 mile hike along the Application Trail. </p><p align='left'> You can view my resume <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_o008KDhAf6LSO5pwT8UTcT_dGaoLvjpxiURRH8xQko/edit?usp=sharing ' target=_blank><u>here</u>.</a></p>
